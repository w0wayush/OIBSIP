          <h3><br>About - </h3>
          <p class="info">Shivaji was descended from a line of prominent nobles. India at that time was under Muslim rule:
            the Mughals in the north and the Muslim sultans of Bijapur and Golconda in the south. All three ruled by right of con
            with no pretense that they had any obligations toward those who they ruled. Shivaji, whose ancestral estates were sit
            in the realm of the Bijapur sultans, found the Muslim oppression and religious persecution of the Hindus so intolerab
            he convinced himself that he was the divinely appointed instrument of the cause of Hindu freedom-a conviction that was 
            to sustain him throughout his life.</p>
          <p class="info">Collecting a band of followers, he began about 1655 to seize the weaker Bijapur outposts. In the process,
            who had aligned themselves with the sultans. All the same, his daring and military skill, combined with his sternness
            His depredations grew increasingly audacious, and several minor expeditions sent to chastise him proved ineffective.</p>
          <p class="info">
            In 1674 during the summer, Shivaji Maharaj had himself enthroned with great fanfare as an independent sovereign. The entire
            He ruled his domain for almost six years through a cabinet of eight ministers. Chattrapati Shivaji Maharaj who devout Hind
            broke the tradition by commanding that two of his relatives who had been forcibly converted to Islam should be taken back
            Even though both the Christians, as well as the Muslims, often kept on imposing their creeds on the population by force,
            Along with Hindus, many Muslims were also in his service. After his coronation, his most remarkable campaign was in the 
            south, during which he forged an alliance with the sultans and thereby blocked the grand design of the Mughals to spread 
            their rule over the entire subcontinent.</p>
